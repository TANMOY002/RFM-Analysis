A particular company who wants to target customers has to be sure that it is targetting the appropriate customers so that its campaign is effective.

The 3 main factors which are of focus here are

Recency- When was the last time the customer had purchased? Here Recency has been measured in days

Frequency-How many transactions did the customer make?

Monetory Value- How much money did the customer spend? Here we have taken the average money the customer had spent in each transaction.
